# Cloud-Based App Example

This is a sample app based on a replaceable backend.

The app uses the cloud data via a [BackendAdapter](https://github.com/AntonioCappiello/cloud-based-app-example/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/antoniocappiello/cloudapp/presenter/backend/BackendAdapter.java) Interface which can be implemented with the backend (BaaS) that you prefer the most.

For the sake of this example I have implemented the backend in [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/),
partially using as inspiration the Udacity's course ["Firebase Essentials For Android"](https://www.udacity.com/course/firebase-essentials-for-android--ud009) by Google.
